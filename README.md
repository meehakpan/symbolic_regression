# Genetic-Programming
Development and implementation of the genetic programming algorithm for the symbolic regression task.
Laboratory task - LISP & GP
The content of the task
Development and implementation of the genetic programming algorithm for the symbolic regression task.
The program should be implemented on Racket environment using Scheme dialect of LISP programming language.
Sample data to solve the symbolic regression problem should be generated by the designer or you can use sample benchmark data from the website http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
Note to the task.
The program created can be done analogously to the one presented by prof. John Koza lecture describing genetic programming. See slides from pages 43 to 72.
A simpler version of the task
I can suggest a modification of the laboratory task as follows.
Implementation of genetic programming to the described symbolic regression problem using Python.
 However, this approach would involve obtaining a maximum of 20 points.
